"""DocTR OCR model training pipeline for the pdomain-* OCR suite.

Two install modes
-----------------
``pip install pdomain-ocr-training``
    Torch-free base install. Exposes the typed config models
    (``DetectionConfig``, ``RecognitionConfig``, ``TrainingEvent``,
    ``DetectionEvalConfig``, ``RecognitionEvalConfig``, ``EvalSlice``,
    ``DetectionEvalResult``, ``RecognitionEvalResult``) and the
    ``ITrainingRunner`` / ``IEvalRunner`` Protocols. Suitable for a
    long-lived web process (e.g. ``pdomain-ocr-trainer-spa``) that only needs
    the interfaces.

``pip install pdomain-ocr-training[train]``
    Adds the heavy training stack (torch / DocTR / matplotlib) and makes
    ``LocalTrainingRunner`` usable. ``LocalEvalRunner`` is torch-free and
    importable in the base install; the real DocTR eval wrappers are a
    follow-up task.

``LocalTrainingRunner`` is exported lazily: it is only imported on first
attribute access. Accessing it without the ``[train]`` extra installed
raises an ``ImportError`` with install guidance rather than a raw
``ModuleNotFoundError`` at package import time.

``LocalEvalRunner`` is also exported lazily for consistency. Resolving the
class does not import torch; its evaluation backend loads the training stack
only when evaluation runs.
